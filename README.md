# CRUD Track Event Roster Website

## Bio

I am Dean Luehrs I am a junior in high school. I have only been coding for 2 years with our high school's Robotics club and part of that was spent in a computer science class. 

## Why This Website Was Made

I made this website so it would be easier for coaches to get information about who wants to compete in which events so they can make rosters of meets with ease. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this website is to have a list of people competing in each event including what grade they are in and how many there are in total.

### How it Was Made

It was made using php, Javascript, CSS, & HTML. It was a HTML file linked with php files that whenever a button was pushed it went to the php files and changed the database and tables according to what was changed. The css and Java helped with astetics.
